## EE6415 Assignment-1
Each question has been solved using separate MATLAB files named according to the question it dealts with. Eg: Question 1 is in Q1.m. Each subsection of the question will be plot in separate MATLAB figure windows. They will be generated by simply running the corresponding .m file for the question.

For plotting the phase portraits, in many questions I use the derivatives.m and in some questions I use derivatives2.m. These files need to be placed in the same directory for the code to successfully run.

**derivatives.m** function generates the derivative values for points in a given mesh, for given derivative function. However the limits are such that it covers the same length in positive and negative x and y axis. **derivatives2.m** function is a little more versatile, one can pass arbitrary starting and ending points for the mesh and can generate corresponding derivative values.

MATLAB's **in-built quiver** function which was taught in class is used to plot the phase portraits after obtaining the derivatives.
